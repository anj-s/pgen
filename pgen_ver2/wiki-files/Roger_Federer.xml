'''Roger Federer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər}}; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional [[tennis]] player who is [[ATP Rankings#Current rankings|ranked]] world No. 3 in men's singles tennis by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings|title=Rankings: Singles|work=ATP World Tour|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won 20 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles—the most in history by a male player—and has held the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|world No. 1]] spot in the [[ATP rankings]] for a record total of 310 weeks (including a record 237 consecutive weeks) and was the year-end No. 1 five times, including four consecutive. Federer, who turned professional in 1998, was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016.

Federer has won a record eight [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles, six [[Australian Open]] titles, five [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] titles (all consecutive, a record), and one [[French Open]] title. He is one of eight men to have achieved a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|Career Grand Slam]]. Federer has reached a record 31 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 consecutively from the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships]] to the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]]. Federer has also won a record six [[ATP Finals]] titles, 28 [[ATP Tour Masters 1000]] titles, and a record 23 [[ATP Tour 500]] titles. Federer is also the only player after [[Jimmy Connors]] to have won 100 or more career singles titles, as well as to amass 1,200 wins in the Open Era.

Federer's all-court game and versatile style of play involve exceptional footwork and shot-making.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; Effective both as a baseliner and a volleyer, his apparent effortlessness and efficient movement on the court have made Federer highly popular among tennis fans. He has received the tour [[ATP World Tour Awards#Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award|Sportsmanship Award]] 13 times and been named the [[ATP Awards|ATP Player of the Year]] and [[ITF World Champion]] five times. He has won the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] award a record five times, including four consecutive awards from 2005 to 2008. He is also the only person to have won the [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] award four times.

[[File:Roger Federer Signature 2013.svg|thumb|right|Federer's signature]]
Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to [[conscription in Switzerland|compulsory military service]] in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was ruled "unsuitable" and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/roger-federer-exempte-pc-143403 |title=Roger Federer: le voici exempté de PC... |work=Le Matin |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2009 |first=Fabian |last=Muhieddine |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018040912/http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/roger-federer-exempte-pc-143403 |archivedate=18 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he served in the civil protection force and was required to pay 3% of his taxable income as an alternative.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2004-02-06-federer-military_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Federer to serve in Swiss civil force, not army | accessdate=25 March 2016 | date=2004-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up supporting [[FC Basel]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/celebrityfans/228/article.aspx |title=Roger Federer – Celebrity fans – Interviews |work=FourFourTwo |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer also credits his [[hand-eye coordination]] to the wide range of sports he played as a child, including [[badminton]] and [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/not-just-tennis/|title=How Badminton Helped Federer's Game|first=Thomas |last=Lin |publisher=Straight Sets|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Federer is married to former [[Women's Tennis Association]] player [[Mirka Federer|Miroslava Federer (née Vavrinec)]], whom he met while they were both competing for Switzerland at the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]].

===2003: Grand Slam breakthrough at Wimbledon===
{{Main|2003 Roger Federer tennis season}}

In 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]].&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]] over [[Andy Roddick]]. At the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer defeated [[Andre Agassi]] in the latter's last major final.&lt;ref name=RF2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2005&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer – 2005 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709073147/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2005&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|archive-date=9 July 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer also took four ATP Masters Series 1000 wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal.

Federer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since [[Pete Sampras]] in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind [[John McEnroe]]'s 1984 and [[Jimmy Connors]]'s 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===2006: Career-best season===

Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1.&lt;ref name=RF2006/&gt; Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old [[Andy Murray]] in the second round of the [[2006 Cincinnati Masters]], in what was Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Near the end of the season he won his hometown tournament, the [[Swiss Indoors]] in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] without dropping a set, beating [[Fernando González]] in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as [[Björn Borg]] at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus07/news/story?id=2744992|title=Federer defeats Gonzalez for 10th Grand Slam title|date=28 January 2007|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, [[Guillermo Cañas]], who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bonnie |last=DeSimone|title=Canas keeps the ball in court in doping case|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2819004|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:The Mighty Federer cropped.jpg|thumb|Federer was coined "Darth Federer" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open]] This surprising first-round defeat marked the first time since August 2006 he suffered defeat, a period spanning over seven months.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

During the clay season, Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set [[Bagel (tennis)|bagel]]. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/scores/2007/520/MS001/match-stats|title=Rafael Nadal VS.

At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|thrilling five-set encounter]] that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since [[1980 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|1980]]. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with [[Björn Borg]] for the record of five consecutive championships at the [[All England Club]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named [[Novak Djokovic]]. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match. Victory in New York moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. Throughout the tournament, the American press labelled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire (which included tuxedo-striped shorts) and the tournament played [[The Imperial March]] from [[Star Wars]] when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2007-09-09/297.php|title=Darth Federer Eyes 12th Slam Today Against Djokovic|last=Tennis-X.com|website=tennis-x.com|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed out the year with victories in [[Swiss Indoors|Basel]] and the [[ATP World Tour Finals|Year End Championships]] in Shanghai.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

He finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three Majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |title=Australian Open Men's Singles Champions |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=15 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064147/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |archivedate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |title=Roland Garros Men's Singles Past Winners 1891–2011 |publisher=Roland Garros |accessdate=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archivedate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |title=Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals |publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |title=US Open Men's Singles Finals |publisher=US Open |accessdate=15 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190523/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |archivedate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===2009: Career Grand Slam and Major title record===
{{Main|2009 Roger Federer tennis season}}

Federer entered the 2009 season with 13 Grand Slams, only one behind Pete Sampras' all-time record. The season began with a loss to Nadal in the final of the Australian Open in a hotly contested five-set match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/rafael-nadal-roger-federer-australian-open|title=Nadal wins battle for place in history by edging past Federer in Melbourne|accessdate=1 February 2009|work=The Guardian|first=Steve|last=Bierley|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer struggled following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
[[File:Roger Federer at the 2009 French Open 6.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Federer winning the French Open, and completing the career Grand Slam.]]

Federer's season turned around in the final masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Masters]].&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to [[Robin Söderling]], Federer became the overwhelming favorite. In his next match, he came from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat [[Tommy Haas]] in five sets.&lt;ref name=RF2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/players/roger-federer/f324/player-activity?year=2009|title=Roger Federer – Player Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also fought back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young [[Juan Martín del Potro]] to win a five setter in the semifinals.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; In [[2009 French Open – Men's singles final|the final]], he faced Söderling, and with straight sets victory, he finally captured the [[Coupe des Mousquetaires]] and career Grand Slam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/sports/tennis/08tennis.html|title=The Greatest?

Federer turned his sights to the grass courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed his way up to the final.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In the championship match he faced long-time rival [[Andy Roddick]] in what was their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} which Federer claimed 16–14 to win his 15th Grand Slam singles title,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer continued his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the [[Cincinnati Masters]], defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; At the US Open he defeated Söderling in the quarters and Djokovic, for the third consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a [[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]] winner, to set up match points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMJ0-1GGf5k|title=Roger Federer – Tweener – US Open 2009 [HD]|last=penabaza|date=21 December 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer played del Potro in the final and led two sets to one before ultimately losing a fourth-set tiebreaker and subsequently the match.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt;

The 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; The [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon final]] was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in the fifth set.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

During the summer, he experimented with various different racquets and played the [[2013 International German Open|German Open]] with a blacked-out 98-inch Wilson racquet, instead of his regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90-inch hitting area.

Federer began the season by changing rackets for the first time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches.

Federer made the final of the [[2014 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]] but was defeated by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Federer defeated Spain's [[David Ferrer]] in three sets to capture his sixth [[2014 Western &amp; Southern Open|Cincinnati]] crown and 22nd [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] title, his first in Cincinnati since 2012. He then reached the semifinals at the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] but lost in straight sets to eventual champion [[Marin Čilić]].

Federer then played in the [[2014 Shanghai Rolex Masters|Shanghai Masters]]. He beat Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, ending the Serb's 28-match unbeaten run on Chinese soil. He battled Frenchman [[Gilles Simon]] in his second Shanghai final, defeating him in two tiebreak sets and collected the 23rd Masters 1000 title of his career.

With the victory Federer returned to the semifinals of the French Open for the first time since 2012, where he lost to 11-time champion Rafael Nadal in straight sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roger Federer to face Rafael Nadal in French Open semi-finals |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/48514159 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 June 2019 |date=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer then began his grass court season at the [[2019 Halle Open – Singles|2019 Halle Open]] where he won his tenth title at the event, defeating David Goffin in the final in straight sets. This marked the first time Federer had won a singles tournament for ten times or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federer Win 10th Halle Title, Sends Wimbledon Warning |url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-goffin-halle-2019-final |publisher=ATP Tour |accessdate=23 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon championships]], Roger Federer reached his record 12th final at the tournament after ousting his nemesis Rafael Nadal in four sets in the semifinal, thus exacting revenge for his earlier defeat to him at the French Open. This was also the first time Federer played Nadal at Wimbledon since the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final|2008 Wimbledon final]], a match regarded by some as the greatest match in the history of tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal in four sets to reach Wimbledon men's final |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/12/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-semi-final-match-report |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 July 2019|date=12 July 2019 |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kevin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer then faced Novak Djokovic in the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final|final]], against whom he lost in a five set thriller lasting four hours and fifty seven minutes, despite having two championship points on serve in the fifth set.

Federer next played at the [[2019 Western &amp; Southern Open – Men's Singles|2019 Cincinnati Masters]] and reached the third round where he lost in straight sets to [[Andrey Rublev (tennis)|Andrey Rublev]].

===Davis Cup===
Federer made his [[Davis Cup]] for [[Switzerland Davis Cup team|Switzerland]] debut in the [[1999 Davis Cup World Group#Switzerland vs. Italy|World Group 1st Round against Italy in 1999]] at 17 years of age. In his first match he defeated [[Davide Sanguinetti]] in four sets and recorded a second singles victory in a dead rubber two days later as Switzerland advanced to the World Group Quarterfinals. In the Quarterfinals Federer, who was still 17 years old, suffered his first Davis Cup loss when he was defeated by Belgian [[Christophe Van Garsse]] in five sets. The Swiss team went on to lose the rubber 3–2. A year later, Federer competed in his first Davis Cup doubles rubber where he teamed with countryman [[Lorenzo Manta]] to defeat Australians [[Wayne Arthurs (tennis)|Wayne Arthurs]] and [[Sandon Stolle]] in four sets. Despite the doubles victory, Federer lost both singles rubbers to [[Mark Philippoussis]] and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] which saw Switzerland sent to the World Group Playoffs for the first time in Federer's career. He returned for the playoffs in July 2000 and led Switzerland to a 5–0 win over [[Belarus Davis Cup team|Belarus]] by recording wins in singles and doubles.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

His first Davis Cup highlight came in 2003 as the newly crowned Wimbledon champion led his country to an historic semifinal run.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} After recording five wins in ties against the [[Netherlands Davis Cup team|Netherlands]] and [[France Davis Cup team|France]], the Swiss team traveled to Melbourne to play the highly rated [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australians]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Federer once again defeated Wimbledon runner-up [[Mark Philippoussis]] in the second rubber but allowed the Australians to lead the tie 2–1 going into Day 3 after dropping the doubles rubber in five sets.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Federer then played Lleyton Hewitt in a sudden death situation for Switzerland and despite leading two sets to love,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} succumbed to a fast finishing Hewitt in five sets.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Australia went on to claim the Davis Cup title months later{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} as Federer's interest in Davis Cup began to wane{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} and his focus shifted to his personal career.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} He skipped many ties over the years but often competed in the World Group Playoffs in order for Switzerland to maintain their place in the top division.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The emergence of countryman [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment paid off as wins over [[Serbia Davis Cup team|Serbia]], [[Kazakhstan Davis Cup team|Kazakhstan]] and [[Italy Davis Cup team|Italy]] allowed the Swiss team to advance to the [[2014 Davis Cup]] Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/20/roger-federer-davis-cup-final-switzerland-france-stan-wawrinka|title=Roger Federer's back problem leaves Davis Cup final on knife edge|first=Kevin|last=Mitchell|date=20 November 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and a second rubber straight sets loss to [[Gaël Monfils]] seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and [[Richard Gasquet]]. Federer defeated Gasquet in straight sets and in doing so handed Switzerland its first (and only to date) Davis Cup title.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer holds many Davis Cup records for Switzerland that includes most total wins, most singles wins and most years played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team.aspx?id=SUI|title=Davis Cup – Teams|website=daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic Games===
An 18-year-old Federer made his [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] debut at [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] in 2000, where he entered the singles competition. He surprised many by reaching the semifinals but lost to [[Tommy Haas]] in the semifinals and then to [[Arnaud Di Pasquale]] in the bronze medal match, causing Federer to leave Sydney empty handed.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Federer was the clear favorite after claiming the world No. 1 ranking earlier in the year and capturing the [[Australian Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles. However, he lost in the second round to 18-year-old Tomáš Berdych. In doubles, he and compatriot [[Yves Allegro]] lost in the second round.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], Federer was again the top seed and favorite, but lost in the quarterfinals to [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. However, he found more success on the doubles court, capturing the gold medal in men's doubles with compatriot Stan Wawrinka, defeating [[Simon Aspelin]] and [[Thomas Johansson]] of [[Sweden at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. At both the Athens and Beijing Olympic Games, Federer was the flagbearer for Switzerland in the [[Olympic opening ceremony|opening ceremony]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]], Federer won his first singles medal, losing to [[Andy Murray]] in the final to claim the silver. He and Wawrinka were unable to defend their gold medal in doubles, losing in the second round to [[Jonathan Erlich]] and [[Andy Ram]] of [[Israel at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Israel]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer did not compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]] after taking the rest of the season off after [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] to recover from a knee injury.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Hopman Cup===
Federer won the [[2001 Hopman Cup]] representing Switzerland, along with [[Martina Hingis]]. The duo defeated the American pair of [[Monica Seles]] and [[Jan-Michael Gambill]] in the finals.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
He also played the next year, along with his current wife [[Mirka Vavrinec]], but they lost in the round robin stage.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer played again at the [[Hopman Cup]] in [[2017 Hopman Cup|2017]], along with [[Belinda Bencic]]. They won all of their ties except the last one, and as a result they couldn't make the final.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In 2018, Federer won his second [[2018 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] title and third overall for [[Switzerland at the Hopman Cup|Switzerland]]. His partner was [[Belinda Bencic]] again. The Swiss team won all the ties and Federer won all his singles and mixed doubles matches. They defeated the German pair, [[Alexander Zverev]] and [[Angelique Kerber]], in the final 2–1.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Federer won his third and second consecutive [[2019 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] title in 2019 alongside [[Belinda Bencic]]. They again defeated [[Alexander Zverev]] and [[Angelique Kerber]] of [[Germany at the Hopman Cup|Germany]] in the final, and won the final tie 2–1 by winning a tiebreak in the final set of the mixed doubles (5–4). Federer again won all of his singles matches. The Swiss team only lost one tie to [[Greece at the Hopman Cup|Greece]] (1–2).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Roger Federer is the most successful individual in Hopman Cup (3 titles) history.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Laver Cup===
Federer founded the [[Laver Cup]], which pits Europe against the rest of the world. The tournament is named in honor of [[Rod Laver]] and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Europe won the [[2017 Laver Cup|inaugural Laver Cup]] in 2017. Federer played his first singles match on day two, when he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, which took place at one set all. This was the first time Federer and Nadal competed on the same side of a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The [[2018 Laver Cup|second edition]] was played in 2018. The European team led by Federer retained the title after defeating Team World, 13–8. Federer won both his singles matches, against Nick Kyrgios and John Isner, but lost both his doubles matches.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Their rivalry includes four Grand Slam event finals, three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open, all won by Federer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Andy Roddick|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-andy-roddick/F324/R485|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddick himself said it was not much of a rivalry, being so one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/173925.html|title=WTA big three one step away from a major rivalry|date=9 October 2012|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match included a 30-game fifth set (a Grand Slam final record) and lasted over four hours. In the final game of the deciding set, Roddick's serve was broken for the first time in the match. With that victory, Federer broke [[Pete Sampras]]' record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles, and Roddick apologised to Sampras (who was in attendance) for not being able to stop Federer.

===Federer vs. Hewitt===
Federer and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] have played 27 times, with Federer leading 18–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Lleyton Hewitt|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-lleyton-hewitt/F324/H432|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. This marked a turning point in the rivalry, as Federer won 16 of the next 18 meetings from 2004 onwards. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel on both sides of a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the [[2014 Brisbane International]], where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the [[2010 Gerry Weber Open|Halle]] title.

Hewitt and Federer teamed up in the men's doubles at Wimbledon in [[1999 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles|1999]]. They lost in the third round to [[Jonas Björkman]] and [[Pat Rafter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-28/federer-praises-hewitt-on-the-eve-of-his-final-wimbledon/6578372|title=Wimbledon: Lleyton Hewitt praised by Roger Federer ahead of SW19 finale|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 June 2015 |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federer vs. Nalbandian===
Federer and [[David Nalbandian]] have played 19 times, with Federer leading 11–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS David Nalbandian|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-david-nalbandian/F324/N301|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Nalbandian]] was Federer's biggest rival in his early career. Nalbandian dominated early on, winning their first five matches from 2002 to 2003. Federer reversed this trend at the [[2003 Tennis Masters Cup|2003 Masters Cup]], where he recorded his first victory, and went on to win 11 of their last 14 meetings. Federer leads 6–5 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass, and 3–1 on clay courts, while Nalbandian leads 2–1 on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian's win in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the [[2005 Tennis Masters Cup|2005 Masters Cup]], and Federer's win in the [[2006 French Open]] semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–2.

[[Marat Safin]] and Federer played 12 times, with Federer leading 10–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Marat Safin|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-marat-safin/F324/S741|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer and Safin turned pro within one year of each other, with Safin turning pro in 1997 and Federer in 1998. Federer leads 4–1 on hard courts, 3–0 on grass, and 3–0 on clay courts, while Safin leads 1–0 on carpet. Notable meetings include Federer's defeating Safin at the 2002 Hamburg Masters to win the first Masters 1000 title of his career, as well as Federer's emerging victorious in the semifinals of the [[2004 Tennis Masters Cup]], after winning a tiebreak 20–18 on his eighth match point. Federer also defeated Safin in the finals of the [[2004 Australian Open]] to capture his first Australian Open and second Grand Slam tournament title. However, Safin defeated Federer in the [[2005 Australian Open]] semifinals, having saved one match point in the fourth-set tiebreak, to end a 26-match winning streak by Federer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/2354682/New-rivalry-has-echoes-of-a-golden-era.html |title=New rivalry has echoes of a golden era|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=10 September 2012 |first=Mark |last=Hodgkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met each other five times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–1.

They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 [[Swiss Indoors]] in Federer's hometown, with [[Andre Agassi]] prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] that spanned over two days, with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the [[2005 Dubai Tennis Championships|2005 Dubai Championships]], Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two men play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel [[Burj al-Arab]]. Their final match was at one of the most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|2005 US Open]]. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.

===Federer vs. Wawrinka===
Federer and his fellow [[Switzerland|Swiss]] player [[Stan Wawrinka]] have played each other 26 times, with Federer leading 23–3. Federer leads 7–1 in Grand Slam tournaments, 17–0 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass courts and 5–3 on clay courts. The pair are 1–1 in finals.

Wawrinka defeated Federer in straight sets during the [[2015 French Open – Men's Singles|2015 French Open]] quarterfinals en route to winning his first French Open title, although Federer then won a straight-sets victory in the [[2015 US Open – Men's Singles|2015 US Open]] semifinals. Other close matches include the [[2012 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles|2012 Shanghai Masters]] and the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles|2013 Indian Wells Masters]], both of which Federer won in three sets, the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2014 Wimbledon]] quarterfinal, which Federer won in four sets, the [[2014 ATP World Tour Finals – Singles|2014 ATP World Tour Final]] semifinal, which Federer won in three sets after saving four match points, and the [[2017 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2017 Australian Open]] semifinal, which Federer won in five sets. Despite their on-court rivalry, they are friends off court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ESPN|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/usopen15/story/_/id/13624554/tennis-roger-federer-stan-wawrinka-temporarily-set-aside-camaraderie|title=Federer, Wawrinka temporarily set aside camaraderie|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have played doubles together on numerous occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tennis Explorer|url=http://www.tennisexplorer.com/doubles-team/federer/wawrinka-ffdb9/?annual=all|title=Federer / Wawrinka Doubles team's record|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably when they won the doubles Olympic Gold at the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles|2008 Beijing Olympics]] and when winning the [[2014 Davis Cup]].

[[Juan Martín del Potro]] and Roger Federer have played 25 times, with Federer leading 18–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Juan Martin Del Potro|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-juan-martin-del-potro/F324/D683|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament meetings came in 2009. The first was in the [[French Open]] semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash when he was on his way to the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where del Potro beat five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's singles|2012 London Olympics]], where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the [[Swiss Indoors]] in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer on last one of them in tight three-set matches.

In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again beat Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he beat Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down. In the final at the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open]] del Potro beat Federer in three close sets, after facing match points in the third set. With this win del Potro won his first Masters 1000 title of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Del Potro Saves 3 M.P. v.

No other male tennis player has won 20 major singles titles in the Open Era, and he has been in 31 major finals, including 10 in a row. He has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for longer than any other male player. He was ranked No. 1 at the age of 36 and has won a record eight Wimbledon titles. He won five consecutive US Open titles, which is the most in the Open Era.

He has been voted by his peers to receive the tour [[ATP World Tour Awards#Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award|Sportsmanship Award]] a record thirteen times and voted by tennis fans to receive the [[ATP World Tour Awards#ATPWorldTour.com Fans' Favorite|ATP Fans' Favorite]] award for fifteen consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/federer-atp-awards-2017|title=Federer Honoured With Three Awards|work=ATP World Tour|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer has been named the Swiss Sports Personality of the Year a record seven times. He has been named the ATP Player of the Year and ITF World Champion five times, and he has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times, including four consecutive awards from 2005 to 2008. He is also the only individual to have won the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award four times.

Federer helped to lead a revival in tennis known by many as the [[Big Four (tennis)|Golden Age]]. This led to increased interest in the sport, which in turn led to higher revenues for many venues across tennis. During this period rising revenues led to exploding prize money; when Federer first won the [[Australian Open]] in 2004 he earned $985,000, compared to when he won in 2018 and the prize had increased to AUD 4{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/overview|title=Roger Federer – Player Activity – ATP World Tour – Tennis|website=ATP World Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon winning the [[2009 French Open]] and completing the career Grand Slam, Federer became the first individual male tennis player to grace the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] since [[Andre Agassi]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c4/5d/49/c45d49278a524d6a107a00c354bb05c0.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first non-American player to appear on the cover of the magazine since [[Stefan Edberg]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicovers.com/SearchResults.aspx?pc=Tennis|title=Search Results|website=sicovers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer again made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' following his record-breaking [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|8th Wimbledon title]] and second Grand Slam of 2017, becoming the first male tennis player to be featured on the cover since himself in 2009.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"/&gt;

==Playing style==
Federer's versatility has been described by [[Jimmy Connors]] as: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you're Roger Federer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/2009/02/20/roger-federer-a-class-act-on-and-off-the-court-leads-tennis-revival/|title=Roger Federer, a class act on and off the court, leads tennis revival|author=sportsfeelgoodstories.com|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dominik Hrbaty]] described what it was like to play Federer in the Scoop Malinowski book "Facing Federer": “Roger is different. He’s the new generation. He was comparable to [[Marcelo Rios]], very talented, he has great hands, but the difference was Roger had the big serve, big return. He could make winners out of anything basically. And even out of defense. And Roger is just one of a kind." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.tennisfrontier.com/news/atp-tennis/facing-federer-dominik-hrbatys-take/&lt;/ref&gt;

An elite athlete, Federer is an [[Tennis strategy#All-court player|all-court, all-around player]] known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/696033/sizzling-on-court-humble-off-court/|title=Hall of Fame: Roger Federer – the Swiss Maestro|first=Aamna |last=Saiyid |work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a powerful, accurate [[smash (tennis)|smash]] and very effectively performs rare elements of professional tennis, such as the backhand smash and [[skyhook (tennis)|skyhook]], half-volley, jump smash (slam dunk) and an aggressive serve return known affectionately as SABR (Sneak Attack By Roger, a half-volley attack on an opponent's second serve). [[David Foster Wallace]] compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of "a great liquid whip",&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html|author=David Foster Wallace|title=Roger Federer as Religious Experience|date=20 August 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2 February 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John McEnroe]] has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/roger-or-rafa-clash-of-the-wimbledon-sex-symbols-860499.html|title=Roger or Rafa: Clash of the Wimbledon sex symbols|work=The Independent|date=5 July 2008|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is also known for his efficient, deceptively effortless movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand, usually considered his weaker wing, and instead hit a powerful and penetrating inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots. He also has great variety with his forehand, able to hit with topspin or pace (or both), thus opening up the court and going in to the forecourt for aggressive volleys.

Federer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the [[Backspin|slice]], occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire [[topspin]] winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; He has averaged 90% of service games won throughout his career, oftentimes coming up victorious in clutch or pressure service games. His [[serve (tennis)|serve]] is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200{{nbsp}}km/h (125{{nbsp}}mph);&lt;ref name=AUSServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray |author=Australianopen.com |accessdate=16 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225093113/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |archivedate=25 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick|author=Wimbledon.org|accessdate=16 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612031302/http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&amp;id=3471097|title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points|first=Ravi |last=Ubha |publisher=ESPN|date=2 July 2008|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he is capable of serving at 220{{nbsp}}km/h (137{{nbsp}}mph).&lt;ref name=AUSServe/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe/&gt; Federer is also accomplished at [[serve and volley]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon2003|first=Stephen |last=Bierley |title=Serve-volley dead?

Later in his career, Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a "[[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]]" or "hotdog". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] against [[Novak Djokovic]], bringing him triple match point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|title=The Tale of Two Tweeners: Federer vs. Llodra|first=Nima |last=Naderi |publisher=bleacherreport.com|date=30 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207163358/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|archivedate=7 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is one of the top players who employ successfully the "squash shot", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since [[Stefan Edberg]] joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Tignor|title=No. 8: The Roger Resurgence|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/12/roger-resurgence/53370/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Bodo|title=The Reliables|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/08/reliables/52464|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2014|authorlink1=Peter Bodo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which he charges forward to receive the second serve and hits a return on the service line. The SABR is a unique shot that Federer owns, in the way that he manages to add enough power and placement into the shot, which makes it very difficult, or close to impossible for the opponent to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2015-09-03/the_sabr_federers_new_bravado.html?chip=2|title=The SABR: Federer's new bravado|website=USOpen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the switch to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with fewer shanks. However this has diminished control and power on his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kamashi |last=Tandon|title=Roger Federer Credits Switch To Bigger Racquet For Improved Backhand|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/03/roger-federer-racquet-change-backhand-rafael-nadal-indian-wells/64840/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=25 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his comeback in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited as the reason for his win against Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th round.

Federer is also noted for his cool demeanour and emotional control on the court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addiction-in-society/201509/why-roger-federer-is-great|title=Why Roger Federer is Great|first=Stanton |last=Peele |publisher=psychologytoday.com|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/sports/tennis/10federer.html|title=Cool Federer Image Was Forged in a Hot Head|first=David |last=Waldstein |work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer declared:
{{bquote|I don't get the anxiety during a match so much anymore. You know, to throw racquets, to toss balls out of the court, scream and stuff. I almost laugh [on the inside] about it a little bit today when an opponent does it.
