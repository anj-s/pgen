Amsterdam's name derives from ''Amstelredamme'',&lt;ref name="Britannica Eleven"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Vol 1, pp. 896–898.&lt;/ref&gt; indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river [[Amstel]]. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world in the [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521845359&amp;ss=exc Cambridge.org], Capitals of Capital -A History of International Financial Centres – 1780–2005, Youssef Cassis, {{ISBN|978-0-521-84535-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century [[canals of Amsterdam]] and the 19–20th century [[Stelling van Amsterdam|Defence Line of Amsterdam]] are on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]]. [[Sloten, Amsterdam|Sloten]], annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century.

As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an [[Global city|alpha- world city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|Globalization and World Cities]] (GaWC) study group. The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;After Athens in 1888 and Florence in 1986, Amsterdam was in 1986 chosen as the [[European Capital of Culture]], confirming its eminent position in Europe and the Netherlands.

== Etymology ==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: A|Other names of Amsterdam]]}}

After the floods of 1170 and 1173, locals near the river Amstel built a bridge over the river and a dam across it, giving its name to the village: "Aemstelredamme". The earliest recorded use of that name is in a document dated 27 October 1275, which exempted inhabitants of the village from paying [[toll bridge|bridge tolls]] to Count [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]].{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|p=19}} This allowed the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the [[County of Holland]], paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. The certificate describes the inhabitants as ''homines manentes apud Amestelledamme'' (people residing near Amestelledamme).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |title=The toll privilege of 1275 in the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106010052/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |archivedate=6 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1327, the name had developed into ''Aemsterdam''.{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|pp=18–20}}

{{Main|History of Amsterdam|Timeline of Amsterdam}}

=== Founding and Middle Ages ===
[[File:Amsterdam (6578772447).jpg|thumb|The [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude Kerk]] was consecrated in 1306 CE.]]
Amsterdam is much younger than Dutch cities such as [[Nijmegen]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Utrecht]]. In October 2008, [[historical geography|historical geographer]] Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then, since [[land reclamation|reclamation of land]] may not have been for farming—it may have been for [[peat]], for use as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html |title=Amsterdam 200 jaar ouder dan aangenomen |accessdate=22 October 2008 |date=22 October 2008 |publisher=Nu.nl |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025045803/http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html |archivedate=25 October 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1345, an alleged [[Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic miracle]] in the [[Kalverstraat]] rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of the Protestant faith]]. The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The ''[[Stille Omgang]]''—a silent walk or [[procession]] in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="stilleomgang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |title=Mirakel van Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808045508/http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |archivedate=8 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the heyday of the Silent Walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam. In the 21st century this has reduced to about 5000.

=== Conflict with Spain ===

In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the [[religious persecution]] of Protestants by the newly introduced [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|Inquisition]]. The revolt escalated into the [[Eighty Years' War]], which ultimately led to Dutch independence.&lt;ref name="80yearswar"&gt;{{cite web

[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Huguenot]]s from France, prosperous merchants and printers from [[Flanders]], and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the [[Low Countries]] found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European [[freedom of the press|free press]].&lt;ref&gt;Case in point: After [[Galileo affair|his trial and sentencing]] in Rome in 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] chose [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] in Amsterdam to publish one of his finest works, ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.

=== Centre of the Dutch Golden Age ===

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's ''[[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]'', during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world.&lt;ref&gt;E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch (New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1982), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the [[Baltic Sea]], North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]].
 
Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading [[Financial centre]] of the western world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html Amsterdam in the 17th century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826132532/http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html |date=26 August 2009 }}, The University of [[North Carolina]] at Pembroke&lt;/ref&gt; In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the international trading Dutch East India Company became the world's first [[stock exchange]] by trading in its own shares.&lt;ref name="The oldest share"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of Amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.

=== Decline and modernisation ===
Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|wars]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] with [[Kingdom of England|England]] and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. However, the later establishment of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 marked a turning point.

[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|A view of Vijzelstraat looking towards the [[Muntplein, Amsterdam|Muntplein]], 1891.]]

The [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal]] was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]], and the [[North Sea Canal]] was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, [[Joseph Conrad]] gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in ''The Mirror of the Sea''.

=== 20th century–present ===
[[File:Amsterdam photochrom2.jpg|thumb|left|Photochrom of Amsterdam's Dam Square at the beginning of the 20th century.]]
Shortly before the First World War, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the ''Aardappeloproer'' (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.&lt;ref name="aardappeloproer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf |title=Aardappeloproer – Legermuseum |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528004443/http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and [[Schellingwoude]], all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |title=Amsterdam city archives |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006135130/https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centraledorpenraad.nl/landelijk-noord/historie {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711234152/http://www.centraledorpenraad.nl/landelijk-noord/historie |date=11 July 2014 }} from website for the centrale dorpen raad (villages central council)&lt;/ref&gt; Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the [[Jordaan]] district in the [[Frederik Hendrikbuurt]] and surrounding neighbourhoods.

[[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 [[Dutch Jews]] were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]], of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the Dutch Communist Party organised the [[February strike]] attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="deportation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Second World War, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, [[sugar|raw sugar]] beets, and [[Tulip]] bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive.&lt;ref name="hongerwinter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/dossiers/60jaarbevrijding/60jaar_hongerwinter.html |title=Kou en strijd in een barre winter |publisher=NOS |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123174846/http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/dossiers/60jaarbevrijding/60jaar_hongerwinter.html#C |archivedate=23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.

Many new suburbs, such as [[Osdorp]], [[Slotervaart (neighborhood)|Slotervaart]], [[Slotermeer]] and [[Geuzenveld]], were built in the years after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="svgeschedenis"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These suburbs contained many public parks and wide open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing,{{clarify|date=January 2017}} politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people.&lt;ref name="stadsherstel"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Amsterdam Metro|metro]] started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of [[Bijlmermeer]] in the city's [[Amsterdam-Zuidoost|Zuidoost]] (southeast) exclave and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect [[Amsterdam Centraal station|Amsterdam Centraal]] and city centre with other parts of the city.

The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's former Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat, were widened and almost all of their houses were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the ''Nieuwmarktrellen'' ([[Nieuwmarkt Riots]]) broke out;&lt;ref name="metrostad"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.

As a result, the demolition was stopped and the highway was never built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as ''Stadsherstel Amsterdam'', were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.&lt;ref name="stadsherstel"/&gt; The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a [[protected area]]. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] (the three concentric canals: Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht) was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amsterdam.nl/kunst-cultuur/grachtengordel/ |title=Grachtengordel Amsterdam Werelderfgoed |language=Dutch|accessdate=5 August 2015 |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/amsterdam-als-koelkastmagneetje|title=Amsterdam als koelkastmagneetje|last=|first=|work=|newspaper=[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]|date=27 July 2016|trans-title=Amsterdam as a fridge magnet|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments have evoked comparisons with [[Venice (Italy)|Venice]], a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winkelomzet in Amsterdamse binnenstad explodeerde in 2015 |url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/30/ECONOMIE/article/detail/4233984/2016/01/28/Winkelomzet-in-Amsterdamse-binnenstad-explodeerde-in-2015.dhtml |accessdate=22 June 2016 |work=Het Parool |date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203133439/http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/30/ECONOMIE/article/detail/4233984/2016/01/28/Winkelomzet-in-Amsterdamse-binnenstad-explodeerde-in-2015.dhtml |archivedate=3 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the river (or lake) [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] to the centre was started in 2003. The project was controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor three by 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geschiedenis van een debacle|work=Het Parool|date=17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Werk aan Amsterdamse Noord-Zuidlijn hervat|url=http://static.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2009/8/19/190809_noordzuid_adam.html|website=NOS.nl|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metro line was completed in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bouw Noord/Zuidlijn is voltooid: metrostations en lijn klaar om proef te draaien|url=https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/177226/bouw-noordzuidlijn-is-voltooid-metrostations-en-lijn-klaar-om-proef-te-draaien|website=at5.nl|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam is located in the Western Netherlands, in the province of [[North Holland]], although it is not its capital which is [[Haarlem]]. The river [[Amstel]] ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]]. Amsterdam is about {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|below sea level]].&lt;ref name="elevation"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large [[polder]]s. A man-made forest, [[Amsterdamse Bos]], is in the southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the [[North Sea]] through the long [[North Sea Canal]].

Amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the [[Amsterdam metropolitan area]] surrounding the city. Comprising {{convert|219.4|km2|1|abbr=off}} of land, the [[city limits|city proper]] has 4,457 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 2,275 houses per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="density"&gt;

Amsterdam has more than {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=off}} of [[Canals of Amsterdam|canals]], most of which are navigable by boat. The city's three main canals are the Prinsengracht, Herengracht, and Keizersgracht.

In the [[Middle Ages]], Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the [[Singel]], which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a [[Port of Amsterdam|seaport]]. It has been compared with [[Venice]], due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/europe/geography-of-amsterdam.htm|title=Adventure|date=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:Nieuwendammerdijk, Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|Winter 2010 in [[Nieuwendammerdijk en Buiksloterdijk]], [[Amsterdam-Noord]].]]
Amsterdam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=4260&amp;cityname=Amsterdam,+North+Holland,+Netherlands&amp;units=|title=Amsterdam, Netherlands Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; strongly influenced by its proximity to the [[North Sea]] to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. While winters and summers are generally mild, temperatures can vary year by year.  There can occasionally be cold snowy winters and hot humid summers.

Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant [[Urban heat island|heat-island effect]], nights rarely fall below {{convert|-5|°C|0}}, while it could easily be {{convert|−12|°C|0}} in Hilversum, {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast.

Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. The average daily high in August is {{convert|22.1|°C|1}}, and {{convert|30|°C}} or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2.

In 1750, Amsterdam was the [[List of largest European cities in history|fourth largest city in western Europe]], behind London (676,000), Paris (560,000) and Naples (324,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F9obDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=amsterdam+population+fourth+largest+city+in+europe+18th+century#v=onepage&amp;q=amsterdam%20population%20fourth%20largest%20city%20in%20europe%2018th%20century&amp;f=false|title=In Pursuit of Privilege: A History of New York City's Upper Class and the Making of a Metropolis|last=Hood|first=Clifton|date=2016-11-08|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231542951|location=|pages=14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the [[Dutch Republic]], which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as [[Leiden]] (about 67,000), [[Rotterdam]] (45,000), [[Haarlem]] (38,000), and [[Utrecht]] (30,000).{{sfn|Frijhoff|Prak|2005|p=9}}

In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly [[Huguenot]]s, [[Flemish people|Flemings]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Westphalia]]ns. Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[History of the Jews in Amsterdam|Jewish]]. Just twenty per cent of them survived the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Netherlands |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-netherlands |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate=24 January 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land-use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called "groeikernen", literally ''cores of growth''. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the [[Public housing|social housing]] projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city'

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], Jews from [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]]. Jews often fled the [[pogrom]]s in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were [[refugee]]s from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in eastern Poland and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] local vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-of-jews-in-amsterdam|title=History of Jews in Amsterdam|website=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=2019-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an absence of an official Jewish [[ghetto]], most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city.

Amsterdam fans out south from the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station]] and [[Damrak]], the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as [[De Wallen]] (English: "The Quays"). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.

The medieval and colonial age [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as ''grachten'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] neighbourhood, with the [[Natura Artis Magistra|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognised by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] bay. Known as the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]], three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the Herengracht (where "Heren" refers to ''Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam'' (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and ''[[gracht]]'' means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the Lords"), Keizersgracht (Emperor's Canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stadsherstel.nl/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |title=SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |publisher=stadsherstel |accessdate=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and outermost canal is the [[Singelgracht]], which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the [[Singel]].

The canals served for defence, [[Water resource management|water management]] and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen dikes]], with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry [[superstructure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic [[Windscreen wiper|windshield wiper]] as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|year=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=978-90-450-1232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the [[Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal]] and the [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]].&lt;ref name="filledincanals"&gt;{{cite web

=== Expansion ===
{{Main|Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century}}
[[File:Brug 127 in de Lijnbaansgracht over de Egelantiersgracht foto 4.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Egelantiersgracht]] lies west of the [[Grachtengordel]], in the [[Jordaan]] neighbourhood.]]
After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, [[Samuel Sarphati]] devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]]. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the ''Paleis voor Volksvlijt''.&lt;ref name="joodsmuseum"&gt;{{cite web

Following Sarphati, civil engineers Jacobus van Niftrik and Jan Kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |title=Van Niftrik's plan at the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143743/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.&lt;ref name="oudzuid"&gt;{{cite web

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: ''Plan Zuid'', designed by the architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], and ''West''. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes.&lt;ref name="archiefberlage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/planning/uitbreidingsplan_berlage/index.en.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112133013/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/planning/uitbreidingsplan_berlage/index.en.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2013 |title=Berlage's Expansion Plan |publisher=Stadsarchief Amsterdam |accessdate=5 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmzberlage"&gt;{{cite web

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by [[Car|motor car]]. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the Bijlmer.&lt;ref name="bijlmer"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Amsterdam Scheepvaarthuis 002.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Scheepvaarthuis]], by architects [[Johan van der Mey]], [[Michel de Klerk]], [[Piet Kramer]] is characteristic of the architecture of the [[Amsterdam School]].]]
Amsterdam has a rich [[History of architecture|architectural history]]. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude Kerk]] (English: Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306.&lt;ref name="Oude Kerk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oudekerk.nl/|title=Oude Kerk official website|accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest wooden building is ''Het Houten Huys''&lt;ref name="houtenhuys"&gt;{{cite web

It is also one of the few examples of [[Gothic architecture]] in Amsterdam. The oldest stone building of the Netherlands, The Moriaan is build in [['s-Hertogenbosch]].

In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own [[Renaissance architecture]]. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect [[Hendrick de Keyser]].&lt;ref name="dekeyser"&gt;{{cite web

This roughly coincided with Amsterdam's [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Philips Vingboons]] and [[Daniël Stalpaert|Daniel Stalpaert]].&lt;ref name="holclass"&gt;{{cite web

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]]. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.&lt;ref name="neostijl"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] style. At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]]. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdamse School]]. Whole districts were built this style, such as the ''Rivierenbuurt''.&lt;ref name="aschool"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. The [[Vondelpark]], the largest park in the city, is located in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] neighbourhood and is named after the 17th-century Amsterdam author [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several [[horeca]] facilities. In the [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]] borough, is the Beatrixpark, named after [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]]. Between Amsterdam and [[Amstelveen]] is the [[Amsterdamse Bos]] ("Amsterdam Forest"), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5&amp;nbsp;million people visit the park, which has a size of 1.000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of [[Central Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amsterdamsebos.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site Amsterdamse Bos – English site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519151059/http://www.amsterdamsebos.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site |date=19 May 2010 }}. [[Government of Amsterdam|City of Amsterdam]]. Retrieved on 27 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amstelpark]] in the [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]] borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636.

The city has three beaches: Nemo Beach, Citybeach "Het stenen hoofd" (Silodam) and Blijburg, all located in the Centrum borough.

The city has many open squares (''plein'' in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, [[Dam Square]], is the main city square and has the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] and [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]]. [[Museumplein]] hosts various museums, including the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Van Gogh Museum]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]]. Other squares include [[Rembrandtplein]], [[Muntplein, Amsterdam|Muntplein]], [[Nieuwmarkt]], [[Leidseplein]], [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]], and [[Waterlooplein]]. Also, near to Amsterdam is the [[Nekkeveld estate]] conservation project.

=== Port of Amsterdam ===
The [[Port of Amsterdam]] is the fourth largest port in Europe, the 38th largest port in the world and the second largest port in the Netherlands by metric tons of cargo. In 2014 the Port of Amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4&amp;nbsp;million tons of cargo, which was mostly [[bulk cargo]].
Amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the Netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year.
In 2019 the new lock in IJmuiden will open; the port will then be able to grow to 125&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in capacity.

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (AEX), now part of [[Euronext]], is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is near [[Dam Square]] in the city centre.

Together with [[Eindhoven]] ([[BrabantStad#Brainport|Brainport]]) and [[Rotterdam]] ([[Port of Rotterdam|Seaport]]), Amsterdam (Airport) forms the foundation of the Dutch economy.&lt;ref name="ref1367203750"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainport.nl/over-brainport|title=Over Brainport|publisher=brainport.nl|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63&amp;nbsp;million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day-trippers visiting the city every year.&lt;ref name="ams2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Figures Amsterdam 2009: Tourism |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/13871/ |publisher=City of Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics |year=2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140135/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/13871/ |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005.&lt;ref name="TourismReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/pdf/2008_toerisme_in_amsterdam.pdf |title=Toerisme in Amsterdam 2006/2007 |accessdate=22 May 2008 |date=January 2007 |author1=Fedorova, T |author2=Meijer, R |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528004444/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/pdf/2008_toerisme_in_amsterdam.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total.&lt;ref name="TourismReport"/&gt; Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated "Rembrandt 400", to celebrate the 400th birthday of [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.&lt;ref name="TourismReport"/&gt;

[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. It is one of the main tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=csX0f7AVM3gC&amp;pg=PA705|year=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7908-6|pages=705–}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|legalised prostitution]] and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known [[red-light district]]. This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by [[sex worker]]s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

=== Retail ===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large high end department stores such as [[De Bijenkorf]] founded in 1870 to small specialty shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets [[P.C. Hooftstraat]] and ''Cornelis Schuytstraat'', which are located in the vicinity of the [[Vondelpark]]. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval [[Kalverstraat]] in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the ''Negen Straatjes'' and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. ''Negen Straatjes'' are nine narrow streets within the ''Grachtengordel'', the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the ''Negen Straatjes'' a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the ''Negen Straatjes'' are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the [[Albert Cuyp Market]], Westerstraat-markt, Ten Katemarkt, and [[Dappermarkt]]. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held on a weekly basis.

=== Museums ===
The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the [[Museumplein]] (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|World's fair]]. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.&lt;ref name="ijsbaan"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.&lt;ref name="museumpleinfacelift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |title=Museumplein krijgt facelift |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807174714/http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |archivedate=7 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The artist most associated with Amsterdam is [[Rembrandt]], whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece ''[[The Night Watch]]'' is one of top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like [[Bartholomeus van der Helst|Van der Helst]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], [[Aelbert Cuyp|Albert Cuyp]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] and [[Paulus Potter]]. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of [[Decorative arts|decorative art]]. This ranges from [[Delftware]] to giant doll-houses from the 17th century. The architect of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10-year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on 13 April 2013 and the Rijksmuseum has remained the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2016 and 2.16&amp;nbsp;million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Van Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a [[Van Gogh Museum|museum dedicated to his work]]. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]]. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum.&lt;ref name="vangogh3"&gt;{{cite web

Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]]. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of modern art. The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]], [[Karel Appel]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]]. After renovations lasting several years the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called 'The Bathtub' due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the [[Verzetsmuseum]] (Resistance Museum), the [[Anne Frank House]], and the [[Rembrandt House Museum]], to the very large, like the [[Tropenmuseum]] (Museum of the Tropics), [[Amsterdam Museum]] (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum), [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] (a dependency of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Saint Petersburg) and the [[Joods Historisch Museum]] (Jewish Historical Museum). The modern-styled [[NEMO (museum)|Nemo]] is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.

Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs which treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including [[John Kraaijkamp Sr.]]; the best-known version is probably that by [[Wim Sonneveld]] (1962). In the 1950s [[Johnny Jordaan]] rose to fame with "[[Geef mij maar Amsterdam]]" ("I prefer Amsterdam"), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighbourhood, the [[Jordaan]] ("Bij ons in de Jordaan"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include [[Tante Leen]] and [[Manke Nelis]]. Other notable Amsterdam songs are "[[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Amsterdam]]" by [[Jacques Brel]] (1964) and "Deze Stad" by [[De Dijk]] (1989).&lt;ref name="lijflied finale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2948441/2011/10/05/Amsterdams-lijflied-de-finale.dhtml|title=Amsterdams lijflied: de finale|date=5 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 poll by Amsterdam newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' that Trio Bier's "Oude Wolf" was voted "Amsterdams lijflied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2965125/2011/10/12/Amsterdams-Lijflied-Stadsbewoners-leven-als-oude-wolven.dhtml|title=Amsterdams Lijflied: Stadsbewoners leven als oude wolven – AMSTERDAMS LIJFLIED – PAROOL|date=12 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the [[Osdorp Posse]] and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

[[AFAS Live]] (formerly known as the Heineken Music Hall) is a concert hall located near the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]] (known as the Amsterdam Arena until 2018). Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and the [[Melkweg]] are located near the [[Leidseplein]]. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from [[indie rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and other popular genres. Other more subcultural music venues are [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom and Zaal 100. [[Jazz]] has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the [[Bimhuis]] being the premier venue. In 2012, [[Ziggo Dome]] was opened, also near Amsterdam Arena, a state-of-the-art indoor music arena.

[[AFAS Live]] is also host to many [[electronic dance music]] festivals, alongside many other venues. [[Armin van Buuren]] and [[Tiesto]], some of the world's leading [[Trance music|Trance]] DJ's hail from the Netherlands and perform frequently in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world, attracting over 350,000 visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/kunst-en-media/ade-vorig-jaar-het-best-bezochte-festival-van-nederland~a4066485/|title=ADE vorig jaar het best bezochte festival van Nederland|date=9 June 2015|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[Melkweg]].

Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]. Their home is the [[Concertgebouw]], which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]] with some of the best [[acoustics]] in the world. The building contains three halls, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts &amp; Figures |url=http://www.concertgebouw.nl/facts-figures|publisher=Concertgebouw NV|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the [[Stopera]], (a word originally coined by protesters against it very construction: ''Stop the Opera[-house]''). This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at ''Waterlooplein'' next to the river [[Amstel]]. The ''Stopera'' is the homebase of [[Dutch National Opera]], [[Dutch National Ballet]] and the [[Holland Symfonia]]. [[Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ]] is a concert hall, which is situated in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly [[20th-century classical music|modern classical music]]. Located adjacent to it, is the ''[[Bimhuis]]'', a concert hall for improvised and [[Jazz]] music.

=== Performing arts ===
[[File:Stadsschouwburg amsterdam.jpg|thumb|[[Stadsschouwburg]], Amsterdam's best known theatre.]]
Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

The [[Stadsschouwburg]] at the [[Leidseplein]] is the home base of [[Toneelgroep Amsterdam]]. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal programme of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theatre space, to be operated jointly with next door [[Melkweg]], will open in late 2009 or early 2010.

The [[Stopera|Dutch National Opera and Ballet]] (formerly known as ''Het Muziektheater''), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to [[Dutch National Opera]] and [[Dutch National Ballet]]. [[Carré Theatre|Royal Theatre Carré]] was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, [[cabaret]] performances and pop concerts.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals. A new theatre has also moved into Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues: Theater Amsterdam is situated in the west part of Amsterdam, on the Danzigerkade. It is housed in a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theatre is the first ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank's life.

On the east side of town there is a small theatre in a converted bath house, the [[Badhuistheater]]. The theatre often has English programming.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). Contemporary popular artists are [[Youp van 't Hek]], [[Freek de Jonge]], [[Herman Finkers]], [[Hans Teeuwen]], [[Theo Maassen]], [[Herman van Veen]], [[Najib Amhali]], [[Raoul Heertje]], [[Jörgen Raymann]], [[Brigitte Kaandorp]] and [[Comedytrain]]. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of [[Boom Chicago]] in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many ''[[bar (establishment)|cafés]]'' (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown ''café'') breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most ''cafés'' have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many [[discothèque]]s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]]. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80. [[Bimhuis]] located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the [[LGBT]] community and nightlife.

On Koninginnedag—that was held each year on 30 April—hundreds of thousands of people travel to Amsterdam to celebrate with the city's residents and Koningsdag is held on 27 April. The entire city becomes overcrowded with people buying products from the ''freemarket,'' or visiting one of the many music concerts.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Government of Amsterdam}}
[[File:Femke Halsema-roel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Femke Halsema]] has been [[Burgemeester|Mayor]] of Amsterdam since 2018.]] 
The city of Amsterdam is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]], a [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] and a [[Burgemeester|mayor]]. Since 1981, the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] was reduced to eight: [[Amsterdam-Centrum]] covering the city centre including the [[Canals of Amsterdam|canal belt]], [[Amsterdam-Noord]] consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]], [[Amsterdam-Oost]] in the east, [[Amsterdam-Zuid]] in the south, [[Amsterdam-West]] in the west, [[Amsterdam Nieuw-West]] in the far west, [[Amsterdam Zuidoost]] in the southeast, and [[Westpoort (Amsterdam)|Westpoort]] covering the [[Port of Amsterdam]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-city-districts|title=Amsterdam City Districts|publisher=Iamsterdam.com|accessdate=12 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820014532/http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-city-districts|archivedate=20 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== City government ===
{{Main|Boroughs of Amsterdam|Municipal council (Netherlands)}}
As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]], a [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] and a government appointed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dutchreview.com/news/politics/electing-a-mayor-in-the-netherlands|title=Electing a mayor in the Netherlands|author=Maria Smith|publisher=DutchReview.com|date=15 February 2018|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burgemeester|mayor]] (''burgemeester''). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilies in maintaining public order. On 27 June 2018 [[Femke Halsema]] (former member of [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for [[GroenLinks]] from 1998 to 2011) was appointed as the first woman to be [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|Mayor of Amsterdam]] by the [[King's Commissioner]] of [[North Holland]] for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]].  and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She replaces [[Eberhard van der Laan]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]) who was the Mayor of Amsterdam from 2010 until his death in October 2017. After the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2014|2014 municipal council elections]], a governing majority of [[Democrats 66|D66]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] and [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] was formed – the first coalition without the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/06/12/three-party-coalition-amsterdam-pvda/|title=Three-party coalition in Amsterdam|author=Britt Slegers|publisher=NL Times|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the [[Burgemeester|Mayor]], the [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] consists of eight ''wethouders'' ('alderpersons') appointed by the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]]: four [[Democrats 66|D66]] alderpersons, two [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] alderpersons and two [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] alderpersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam.nl/gemeente/college/|title=College van burgemeester en wethouders|language=Dutch|publisher=City of Amsterdam|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2017 it was announced by [[Eberhard van der Laan]] in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that [[Kajsa Ollongren]] would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam with immediate effect due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;https://nos.nl/artikel/2193622-zieke-amsterdamse-burgemeester-van-der-laan-legt-werk-neer.html/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ollongren was succeeded as acting Mayor by Eric van der Burg on 26 October 2017 and by [[Jozias van Aartsen]] on 4 December 2017.

[[File:Amsterdamse stadsdelen 2010.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Boroughs of Amsterdam]]]]
Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.

Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.

The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.

=== Metropolitan area ===
[[File:Police Headquarters, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Police Headquarters of Amsterdam.]]
"Amsterdam" is usually understood to refer to the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

[[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].

The smallest of these areas is the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013.&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013.&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013.&lt;ref name="cbs2013"/&gt; Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]]. The largest area by population, the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33 million.&lt;ref name=dosamsterdam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |title=Dienst onderzoek &amp; statistiek Amsterdam |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614030427/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |archivedate=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerland, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area [[Randstad]], with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="randstad"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population |work=Themes |publisher=City of Amsterdam |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/2008_mutatiestatistiek_stand.xls |format=in Dutch |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadsregioamsterdam.nl/algemene-onderdelen/english-information/|title=Stadsregio Amsterdam: English Information|publisher=Stadsregio Amsterdam|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]], Amsterdam is the [[capital of the Netherlands]]. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("''de hoofdstad Amsterdam''").&lt;ref name="capital-constitution"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dutch Wikisource |title=Grondwet voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden |trans-title=Constitution for the Kingdom of the Netherlands |language=Dutch |url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Grondwet_voor_het_Koninkrijk_der_Nederlanden |at=[http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet/Hoofdstuk_2#Artikel_32 Chapter 2, Article 32] |quote=... de hoofdstad Amsterdam ... |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned "the city of Amsterdam" ("''de stad Amsterdam''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet |title=Previous versions of the constitution |language=nl |publisher=Nl.wikisource.org |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a royal investiture, therefore, the [[States General of the Netherlands]] (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] on [[Dam Square]], immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in [[The Hague]], the city which has historically been the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch supreme court]]. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

[[File:NoordZuidLijn Metrostation Europaplein hnapel 004.jpg|thumb|The [[Amsterdam Metro]] is a mixed subway and above ground [[Rapid Transit|rapid transit system]] consisting of five lines.]]
Currently, there are sixteen [[Trams in Amsterdam|tram routes]] and five [[Amsterdam Metro|metro routes]]. All are operated by municipal public transport operator [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]] (GVB), which also runs the city bus network.

Four fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]] to the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] of [[Amsterdam-Noord]], and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a [[boat sharing]] operation, electric rental boats and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by [[Connexxion]] and [[Egged (company)|EBS]]. International coach services are provided by [[Eurolines]] from [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station]], [[IDBUS]] from [[Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station]], and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.

In order to facilitate easier transport to the center of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iamsterdam.com/nl/op-bezoek/parkeren/parkeren-en-verder-reizen|title=Parkeren + Reizen (P+R) Amsterdam – I amsterdam|website=www.iamsterdam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of [[Kilometre Zero]], of the [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|highway system of the Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="Autosnelweg 1930"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/asw/gs04.htm |title=Autosnelweg.nl – Geschiedenis Autosnelwegen in Nederland |accessdate=19 April 2007 |publisher=Autosnelweg.nl |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310145952/http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/asw/gs04.htm |archivedate=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city.&lt;ref name="Autosnelweg 1930"/&gt; The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]], [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2]], and [[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]] originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The [[A3 motorway (Netherlands)|A3]] to [[Rotterdam]] was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the [[Groene Hart]]. Road [[A8 motorway (Netherlands)|A8]], leading north to [[Zaandam]] and the [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10]] [[Beltway|Ringroad]] were opened between 1968 and 1974.&lt;ref name="Autosnelweg 1970"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the [[A7 motorway (Netherlands)|A7]] and [[A6 motorway (Netherlands)|A6]], carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.

The [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10 ringroad]] surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|national network of freeways]]. [[Interchange (road)|Interchanges]] on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 ''city roads'', numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without [[grade separation]], and sometimes without a [[central reservation]]. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 ''Centrumring'' is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.

In the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are [[One-way traffic|one-way]].&lt;ref name="Fiets"&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Cycling in Amsterdam}}
[[File:Amsterdam - Bicycles - 1058.jpg|thumb|Police bicyclist crossing a bridge over the Prinsengracht.]]
Amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in the world and is a centre of [[bicycle culture]] with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and [[Bicycle stand|bike racks]], and several guarded bike storage garages (''fietsenstalling'') which can be used.

In 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in Amsterdam outnumbering the number of citizens in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research and Statistics Division |title=Introduction |work=Traffic and Infrastructure |language=Dutch |publisher=City of Amsterdam |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/feitenencijfers/24106/ |accessdate=4 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316224718/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/feitenencijfers/24106/ |archivedate=16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theft is widespread{{mdash}}in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Education ==
[[File:Agnietenkapel Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The Agnietenkapel Gate at the [[University of Amsterdam]], founded in 1632 as the Athenaeum Illustre.]]
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (''Universiteit van Amsterdam'', UvA), and the ''[[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]]'' (VU). Other institutions for higher education include an [[art school]] – [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]], a [[Hogeschool|university of applied sciences]] – the [[Hogeschool van Amsterdam]], and the [[Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten]]. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning [[social history]], and especially the [[labor history (discipline)|history of the labour movement]]. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world,&lt;ref name="Hortus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|title=Hortus Botanicus official website|publisher=2009 de Hortus|accessdate=10 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831051745/http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|archivedate=31 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many old and rare specimens, among them the [[coffee|coffee plant]] that served as the parent for the entire [[coffee culture]] in Central and South America.&lt;ref name="he"&gt;{{cite web

There are over 200 primary schools in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [https://www.amsterdam.nl/onderwijs-jeugd/basisonderwijs/stedelijk/ Stedelijk Toelatingsbeleid], Municipality of Amsterdam, 2015. Retrieved on 20 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]] schools. The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

Schools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the [[Amsterdam International Community School]], [[British School of Amsterdam]], [[Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam]], [[Lycée Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam]] primary campus (French school), [[International School of Amsterdam]], and the [[Japanese School of Amsterdam]].

== Notable people ==
{{main|List of people from Amsterdam}}

== Media ==
Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media. Some locally based newspapers include ''[[Het Parool]]'', a national daily paper; ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers ''[[Trouw]]'', ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' and ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''; ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'', a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers ''[[Sp!ts]]'', ''[[Metro (Dutch newspaper)|Metro]]'', and ''[[The Holland Times]]'' (printed in English).

Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Dutch commercial TV group [[SBS Broadcasting Group]], consisting of TV-stations [[SBS 6]], [[Net 5]] and [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]]. However, Amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of [[Hilversum]], {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Netherlands]], heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.

In 2012, the music video of Far East Movement, 'Live My Life', was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.

Also, several movies were filmed in Amsterdam, such as [[James Bond]]'s [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]], [[Ocean's Twelve]], [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]] and [[The Hitman's Bodyguard]]. Amsterdam is also featured in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', which has been made into [[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|a film]] as well that partly takes place in Amsterdam.

== Housing ==
The housing market is heavily regulated. In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.{{Citation needed|reason=stat needs ref|date=August 2019}}

From the late 1960s onwards many buildings in Amsterdam have been [[Squatting|squatted]] both for housing and for using as social centres.&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Owens |first1=Lynn |title=Cracking the Movement: Narrating the Decline of the Amsterdam Squatters' Movement |date=2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |location=Pennsylvania |isbn=9780271034638}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these squats have legalised and become well known, such as [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[Vrankrijk]].
