'''''Veep''''' is an American [[political satire]] comedy television series that aired on [[HBO]] from April 22, 2012, to May 12, 2019.&lt;ref name="PremiereDateAnnounced"/&gt; The series was created by [[Armando Iannucci]] as an adaptation of his sitcom ''[[The Thick of It]]''. The protagonist of ''Veep'' is [[Selina Meyer]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), a fictional [[Vice President of the United States]]. The series follows Meyer and her team as they attempt to make their mark and leave a legacy but often instead become mired in day-to-day political games.

''Veep'' received critical acclaim and won several major awards, including seven consecutive nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], winning that award for its fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. Its second, fourth, and sixth seasons won the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Comedy Series]], and its third season won the [[TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy|Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy]].

Louis-Dreyfus' performance won her six consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Primetime Emmy Awards]], three [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], two [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Award]], and five consecutive [[Golden Globe]] nominations. For his portrayal of Selina's personal aide, Gary, [[Tony Hale]] received six consecutive Emmy nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]], winning in 2013 and 2015. Other members of the cast who received Emmy nominations include [[Anna Chlumsky]] (six nominations), [[Gary Cole]] (one nomination), [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] (two nominations), [[Martin Mull]] (one nomination), [[Hugh Laurie]] (one nomination), and [[Peter MacNicol]] (one nomination).

==Synopsis==
The series follows the personal life and political career of [[Selina Meyer]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and, later, [[President of the United States]]. Her [[political party|party]] affiliation is never discussed, although it is hinted in the fourth season finale that it is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. Formerly a [[United States Senator]] from [[Maryland]], Meyer campaigns for her party's nomination in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] and is initially the [[front-runner]], but ultimately loses the nomination to Stuart Hughes. Meyer subsequently joins the Hughes ticket as his [[running mate]] and is elected Vice President. Her staff as Vice President, upon whom Meyer is almost totally reliant, includes [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff]] Amy Brookheimer ([[Anna Chlumsky]]); director of communications Mike McLintock ([[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]); deputy director of communications Dan Egan ([[Reid Scott (actor)|Reid Scott]]); [[body man]] Gary Walsh ([[Tony Hale]]); and personal secretary Sue Wilson ([[Sufe Bradshaw]]). Later additions to her team as president include [[White House Chief of Staff]] Ben Cafferty ([[Kevin Dunn]]) and political strategist Kent Davison ([[Gary Cole]]). Jonah Ryan ([[Timothy Simons]]), initially a [[White House]] liaison to the Vice President's office and later a [[New Hampshire]] [[Member of Congress|congressman]], also features prominently.

Meyer frequently finds herself relegated and ignored by Hughes, who is never depicted on-screen at the outset of the series. In the second season, Meyer comes to accrue some power and influence and, by the end of the season, is actively considering challenging Hughes for their party's nomination in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. This becomes a [[mootness|moot point]] when Hughes abruptly resigns and Meyer begins her presidential campaign at the end of the third season. The fourth season finds her adjusting to her new role while continuing her presidential campaign, both of which are undermined by a series of scandals. The election results in a [[tie (draw)|tie]] between Meyer and challenger Bill O'Brien ([[Brad Leland]]), leading to a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] during the fifth season to decide the next president after a [[election recount|recount]] in [[Nevada]] fails to alter the election's outcome. The House vote ends in a tie; meaning that when the [[United States Senate|Senate]] votes to elect the Vice President the winner will be the next president. The Senate vote also ends in a tie; Meyer's disgruntled Vice President Andrew Doyle ([[Phil Reeves]]), who did not run for a full term, casts the [[casting vote|tiebreaking vote]] for O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez ([[Andrea Savage]]) instead of Meyer's running mate Tom James ([[Hugh Laurie]]), leading to Montez becoming president. The sixth season follows Meyer out of office for the first time in the series, as she attempts to ensure her legacy by authoring a [[memoir]], setting up a [[private foundation|foundation]] and attempting to establish a [[presidential library]]. At the end of the season, Meyer decides to run for president again. The seventh season sees Meyer attempting to run for president once again in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]], featuring her former political rivals Ryan and James as major competitors, in addition to introducing the young, likable, and progressive challenger Kemi Talbot ([[Toks Olagundoye]]).

The series also explores Meyer's personal life, such as her strained relationships with her daughter Catherine ([[Sarah Sutherland]]), ex-husband Andrew ([[David Pasquesi]]), and several [[significant other]]s. The lives, careers, and relationships of the other characters are also explored, frequently intersecting with the series' principal narrative, satirizing the political activities and inner workings of the contemporary [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].

* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as [[Selina Meyer]] ([[née]] Eaton):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/selina-meyer/index.html|title=Selina Meyer played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus|publisher=HBO|access-date=March 22, 2013|archive-date=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905223342/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/selina-meyer/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born Selina Catherine Eaton, a former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from Maryland who, in the start of the series, is the titular [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], or "Veep", who has a strained relationship with the [[President of the United States|President]]. After the President declines to run for a second term, she begins campaigning for the presidency in Season 3. At the end of Season 3, she becomes President when he resigns for personal issues. Due to a complex manipulation of constitutional law, she loses the presidential race in Season 5. After trying to decide what her post-presidential legacy should be during Season 6, she decides to run for another term as President by Season 7. She is divorced with one daughter, but remains romantically entangled with her ex-husband during the first two seasons and the sixth. She seems to display little or no maternal instinct towards her daughter. Louis-Dreyfus has received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, winning a record-breaking six [[Primetime Emmy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/17/entertainment/julia-louis-dreyfus-emmys/index.html|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes Emmy history|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|date=September 18, 2017|publisher=CNN|access-date=September 18, 2017|archive-date=September 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918024521/http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/17/entertainment/julia-louis-dreyfus-emmys/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and receiving five consecutive [[Golden Globe]] nominations.
* [[Anna Chlumsky]] as Amy Brookheimer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/amy-brookheimer/index.html|title=Amy Brookheimer played by Anna Chlumsky|publisher=HBO|access-date=March 22, 2013|archive-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831091025/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/amy-brookheimer/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|Vice President's Chief of Staff]]. She credits herself as the Vice President's "trouble-shooter, problem-solver, issue-mediator, doubt-remover, conscience-examiner, thought-thinker and all-round everything-doer". Amy is constantly sacrificing her own reputation to save Selina's political credibility. She is known to be uptight and overly dedicated to her career, unwilling to settle down and have children, much to the dismay of her family. She has romantic history with Dan, and may still have feelings for him. She has a few different boyfriends throughout the series, including a fundraiser for Selina and a [[Nevada]] politician. Amy becomes Selina's campaign manager during her presidential run, but resigns as a result of the brief appointment of an equivocating, yet omnipresent, old friend of Selina's to the campaign team. She rejoins the Meyer team when a tie in the general election leads to a statewide recount in Nevada. At the end of season 6 it is revealed that after a one-night stand with Dan, she is pregnant with his child. However, she gets an abortion in Season 7, mainly due to Dan's inability to settle down. In season 7, Amy leaves Selina's team to join Jonah's presidential campaign, becoming his campaign manager and encouraging his unorthodox demeanor and presentation of conspiracy theories as fact. Chlumsky previously portrayed a similar character, Liza Weld, in Iannucci's 2009 film, ''[[In the Loop (film)|In the Loop]]''. She received six consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for her performance.
* [[Tony Hale]] as Gary Walsh:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/gary-walsh/index.html|title=Gary Walsh played by Tony Hale|publisher=HBO|access-date=March 22, 2013|archive-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831164054/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/gary-walsh/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selina's personal aide and [[body man]]. A long-term associate and confidant of Selina, Gary is portrayed as incredibly loyal and devoted. Despite his menial job, Gary is actually a graduate of [[Cornell University]], having majored in [[hotel management]]. In the fourth and fifth seasons, Gary is portrayed as having issues adapting to Selina's presidency, since he can no longer be as close to her as previously, due to lack of security clearance. When Selina fails to win reelection, he remains on as her personal aide. Hale describes Gary's loyalty to Selina stemming from the idea that the character "is one of those guys who never really had an identity. He attached himself to people to find who he was."&lt;ref name="halevariety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/tony-hale-veep-arrested-development-1201472407/|title=Tony Hale on 'Veep' and Playing the Bad Guy for a Change|last=Birnbaum|first=Debra|date=April 16, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=March 18, 2016|archive-date=March 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320210941/http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/tony-hale-veep-arrested-development-1201472407/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hale received two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for his performance on the series, with four further nominations.

He has dated the daughters of influential politicians to get ahead in his career. He often butts heads with Amy, whom he previously dated (and it is suggested he may still have feelings for her). He has a brief stint as Selina's campaign manager for her Presidential campaign but is fired from that position after having a nervous breakdown following several crises. He resumes his post in Communications but is fired as a scapegoat amid a data-theft scandal. After briefly working unsuccessfully as a lobbyist and as a [[CNN]] analyst, he returns to the campaign staff, as a senior campaign official. When Selina fails to win reelection, Dan goes to work as a lead anchor on ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. In Season 7, he joins Selina's new reelection campaign.
* [[Timothy Simons]] as Jonah Ryan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/jonah-ryan/index.html|title=Jonah Ryan played by Timothy Simons|publisher=HBO|access-date=March 22, 2013|archive-date=October 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008065404/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/jonah-ryan/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the White House liaison to Vice President Meyer's office, he constantly clashes with most members of the Veep's office, particularly Amy. It is shown that he is disliked by everyone he encounters, even foreign politicians. In the third season, he is temporarily fired from the White House for running a blog disclosing insider information, leading him to create his own news website, ''Ryantology''. In season four, he works again as a liaison, this time between President Meyer and Vice President Doyle. He later works for the Meyer general election campaign, until a New Hampshire congressman dies. He is then drafted to run for that seat in order to secure Meyer's vote in the electoral college. He is elected and becomes a congressman, appointing Richard as his Chief of Staff; as he begins his congressional term, he is diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] and undergoes treatment, entering remission by Season 6. In season 7, Jonah launches a presidential campaign to compete with Selina's for the nomination of their party; while initially a long-shot candidacy, Jonah begins to receive traction following his promotion of numerous conspiracy theories such as supporting the [[vaccine hesitancy|anti-vax movement]] and alleging that math was created by [[Muslims]] and should not be taught in schools, with Amy joining his campaign as his campaign manager. He ultimately becomes Vice President in the second Meyer administration. According to [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]], Jonah Ryan was originally envisioned by the show's writers as "just a fat, short, heavy smoker", but was changed to his current characterization after Simons auditioned for the role.&lt;ref name="walshdeadline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/veep-matt-walsh-interview-a-better-you-1201448090/|title=Matt Walsh On How Improv Informs 'Veep': "I Wasn't Scared Putting My Script Down" – Emmys|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|date=June 18, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=March 18, 2016|archive-date=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321113445/http://deadline.com/2015/06/veep-matt-walsh-interview-a-better-you-1201448090/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike has served as her Communications Director since her tenure as Senator from Maryland. His career dedication is often questionable, to the extent where he pretends to have a pet dog so he can escape from work commitments. The other characters in the show often mock his lack of ambition, suggesting that he's reached the peak of his career. He is often portrayed as lacking the skills required for the job. In the third season, he marries a reporter named Wendy Keegan. In Season 4, Mike becomes the [[White House Press Secretary]]. In Season 5, Mike and Wendy attempt to adopt a baby. They ultimately adopt a Chinese toddler, and also have twins via a surrogate. In Season 6, he is employed by Selina to write her biography ''A Woman First'' but causes a scandal soon after its publication whereby the true nature of the Meyer Administration was revealed due to him leaving the diary he used for research at the offices of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Walsh received two [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for his performance.

A direct and no-nonsense personality, Sue boasts she is the third most important person in the world, as she is the one who arranges for people to see Selina, the second most important person in the world. During a committee inquiry into Selina's office, the chairperson states that Sue "could organize the D-Day landings and still have time for Iwo Jima." Sue becomes the Chief of Scheduling for the White House in Season 4. She remains in that capacity when President Montez is inaugurated. Bradshaw based her character on that of a [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] employee, elaborating that, "DMV workers are strait-laced and go by the book, and they don't have much time because there's so much to do in a day."&lt;ref name="bradshawdigitaljournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/entertainment/a-conversation-with-veep-s-sufe-bradshaw/article/381890|title=A conversation with 'VEEP's Sufe Bradshaw|last=Peterman|first=Mindy|date=April 23, 2014|publisher=Digital Journal|access-date=March 18, 2016|archive-date=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321123156/http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/entertainment/a-conversation-with-veep-s-sufe-bradshaw/article/381890|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; (seasons 1–5; guest season 7)
* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Ben Cafferty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/ben-cafferty/index.html|title=Ben Cafferty, played by Kevin Dunn|publisher=HBO|access-date=May 11, 2016|archive-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831095607/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/ben-cafferty/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[White House Chief of Staff]], under both the unseen former President and President Meyer. Although he is depressed and a high-functioning alcoholic, he is often very insightful and is treated with respect and even fear throughout Washington. Ben shows little regard for his co-workers or his job, and appears to love his nine-cup coffee thermos more than anything else. Selina refers to him as a "burned-out loser", but he apparently considers her a close friend and resolves to help her become President. Though he was planning on leaving the White House imminently, he agrees to remain with the administration indefinitely. When Selina fails to win reelection, he joins Congressman Ryan's staff with Kent. (Seasons 3–7; recurring season 2)
* [[Gary Cole]] as Kent Davison:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/kent-davison/index.html|title=Kent Davison, played by Gary Cole|publisher=HBO|access-date=May 11, 2016|archive-date=October 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009181040/http://www.hbo.com/veep/cast-and-crew/kent-davison/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Senior Strategist to the President, under both the unseen former President Hughes and later President Meyer. He is a number-cruncher, and is often referred to as being cold and robotic. His obsession with polling statistics is shown to negatively influence the President's decision-making during several episodes in the second season. Kent is also focused on the public images of Selina and Catherine. It is implied that he and Sue are in some form of ersatz relationship. Although Selina initially dislikes him, she comes to appreciate his useful polling and statistical data, and he becomes a key part of her Presidential administration. When Selina fails to win reelection, he joins Congressman Ryan's staff with Ben. Cole received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for his performance. (seasons 4–7; recurring seasons 2–3)
* [[Sam Richardson (actor)|Sam Richardson]] as Richard Splett: an amiable, if not always completely competent, campaign aide who fills in for Gary during Selina's book tour, later becoming Amy's assistant on Selina's presidential campaign, and then briefly Jonah's personal assistant. Splett is cheerful and often the butt of jokes. In Season 5, Selina promotes Richard after discovering he has a doctorate in electoral law. As part of Richard's promotion, Jonah becomes his assistant. When Jonah is elected to Congress, Richard becomes his Chief of Staff. Richard makes many allusions to his blog, splettnet.net. After losing the presidency, Selina hires him to be her Chief of Staff for the Meyer Fund. During season 6, he becomes the sperm donor for Catherine and Marjorie's baby. Richard begins his own political career in season 7, after being asked to serve as mayor of his small hometown in Iowa. He quickly rises through the ranks, becoming [[Lieutenant Governor of Iowa]] after accidentally exposing a corruption scandal that causes the incumbent to resign, and [[Governor of Iowa|Governor]] after Jonah accidentally infects the incumbent with a deadly strain of [[chickenpox]]. In the season 7 epilogue, Richard is revealed to become a successful two-term president. (seasons 4–7; recurring season 3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/09/sam-richardson-veep-regular-835591/|title=Sam Richardson Upped To Regular On 'Veep'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=September 17, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=September 23, 2014|archive-date=September 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922125526/http://deadline.com/2014/09/sam-richardson-veep-regular-835591/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sarah Sutherland]] as Catherine Meyer: Selina's reserved, put-upon daughter. Catherine is often caught in the middle of Selina's issues, especially with her father. She is shown as generally unable to gain her mother's respect or attention. She tends to have highly liberal views concerning social justice. During the first four seasons, she is a film major at [[Vassar College]]. She briefly attracts attention for dating a Persian student. Later, she dates and becomes engaged to a lobbyist her mother dislikes. Selina initiates the demise of their relationship by declaring that they've broken up during an inquiry into her administration. Catherine goes along with the breakup to protect her mother's administration. She is seen in the fifth season filming a documentary based on the unprecedented Electoral-College tie that concludes Selina's presidential run, and she becomes romantically involved with her mother's lookalike bodyguard, Marjorie. In the season 6 finale, she gives birth to son Richard, conceived by artificial insemination, with Richard Splett as the donor. Catherine and Marjorie later marry in season 7, with Selina using their wedding in Norway as a diversion to escape [[Interpol]] and return to the United States, much to Catherine's chagrin. She ends her relationship with her mother permanently after Selina promises to end [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] in order to win the presidency, which she ultimately is successful in. (season 7; recurring seasons 2–6; guest season 1)
* [[Clea DuVall]] as Marjorie Palmiotti: Selina's bodyguard and lookalike. She resigns when she begins a relationship with Catherine. In the season 6 premiere, her relationship with Catherine has progressed rapidly, and they later marry in season 7. After Selina leaves office as president, Marjorie is hired to serve as Director of the Meyer Fund. (season 7; recurring seasons 5–6)

===''The Thick of It''===

====BBC series====
Before creating ''Veep'', British satirist [[Armando Iannucci]] created the [[BBC]] sitcom ''[[The Thick of It]]'', set in a fictional department of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. ''The Thick of It'' was first broadcast in 2005 and won a number of awards. Iannucci directed a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film, ''[[In the Loop (film)|In the Loop]]'', which was released in 2009 and nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

====ABC pilot====
A pilot for an American version of ''The Thick of It'' was produced as a candidate for the 2007–08 season on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Also titled ''The Thick of It'', it was developed for American audiences by writers [[Mitch Hurwitz]] and [[Richard Day (writer)|Richard Day]] and followed a low-level member of the [[United States Congress]] and his staff. Iannucci had a production credit on the show, but he was not otherwise involved. The pilot was produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[BBC Worldwide]] and directed by [[Christopher Guest]].&lt;ref name="Zap2it0226"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/zap-christopherguestdirectingthethickofit |title=Christopher Guest Jumps Into 'The Thick of It' |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |date=February 26, 2007|access-date=March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pilot, [[John Michael Higgins]] played newly-elected Congressman Albert Alger, and [[Oliver Platt]] played committee chairman Malcolm Tucker.&lt;ref name="Zap2it0309"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/zap-pilotcasting-oliverplattchrislowell |title=Platt, 'Piz' Pluck Pilot Parts |date=March 9, 2007 |access-date=March 16, 2007 |publisher=Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhea Seehorn]] portrayed Ollie Tadzio, an ambitious young speechwriter, and [[Michael McKean]] played Glen Glahm, "a former campaign operative who's now the Chief of Staff" for the congressman.&lt;ref name="Zap2it0315"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/zap-gilmoregirlsmelissamccarthyjoinsabcpilot |title='Gilmore' Regular Joins ABC Pilot |date=March 15, 2007 |access-date=March 16, 2007 |publisher=Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC did not pick up the show for its fall 2007 schedule.&lt;ref name="SFChron070521"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Sometimes-buzz-about-TV-pilots-is-just-a-lot-of-2593112.php |title=Sometimes buzz about TV pilots is just a lot of hot air |access-date=May 27, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |first=Tim |last=Goodman |date=May 21, 2007 |archive-date=October 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020163524/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Sometimes-buzz-about-TV-pilots-is-just-a-lot-of-2593112.php |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iannucci distanced himself from the pilot, stating, "It was terrible...they took the idea and chucked out all the style. It was all conventionally shot and there was no improvisation or swearing. It didn't get picked up, thank God."&lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosser|first=Michael|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/iannacci-in-talks-with-hbo-over-us-thick-of-it/2021907.article|title=Iannacci in talks with HBO over US Thick of It|work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date=April 24, 2009|access-date=April 24, 2009|archive-date=July 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703051430/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/iannacci-in-talks-with-hbo-over-us-thick-of-it/2021907.article|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HBO development of ''Veep''===
After ''The Thick of It'' was dropped by ABC, several networks including [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[NBC]] expressed interest in adapting the show.&lt;ref name="Yahoo070604"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/04/us-thick-idUSN0441749720070604 |title=Rejected by ABC, political satire sparks interest |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=June 4, 2007 |publisher=Reuters |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101003252/http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/04/us-thick-idUSN0441749720070604 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iannucci re-entered talks with HBO (his initial preference) about adapting the series, with the result that a new pilot episode for a series situated in the office of the [[Vice President of the United States]] called ''Veep'' (a nickname derived from the position's initials "VP") was commissioned in late 2009.&lt;ref name="HBO" /&gt; Iannucci was given much more creative control over the production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/04/armando-ianucci-hbos-veep.html |title=Armando Iannucci talks political satire and new HBO series 'Veep' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 20, 2012 |access-date=May 11, 2016 |archive-date=June 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604144049/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/04/armando-ianucci-hbos-veep.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-wrote the pilot with British comedy writer [[Simon Blackwell]], who also contributed to the British series ''[[The Thick of It]]''.&lt;ref name="OrderedToSeries"/&gt;

Series creator Armando Iannucci departed as [[showrunner]] following the fourth season's end of production. Iannucci stated that his continuing busy schedule, as well as the challenge of maintaining his family life while switching between [[Baltimore]] and London, would not allow him to "[dedicate] one hundred percent" as head of the show, and he had chosen to "fire" himself as a result. [[David Mandel]] took over as showrunner for future episodes, becoming ''Veep'''s first American writer. Mandel retained a small number of Ianucci's writing staff, as well as [[Chris Addison]] as director and supervising producer, whilst also bringing in his own staff, and American writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/veep-creator-armando-iannucci-depart-787794 |title='Veep' Creator Armando Iannucci to Depart After Four Seasons (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Kate |last=Stanhope |date=April 10, 2015 |access-date=April 11, 2015 |archive-date=April 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412221037/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/veep-creator-armando-iannucci-depart-787794 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtveep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/veep-creator-armando-iannucci-explains-why-hes-still-leaving-show-season-5-after-best-2106324|title='Veep' Creator Armando Iannucci Explains Why He's Still Leaving The Show Before Season 5 After Best Comedy Series Emmy Win|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tyler|last2=Castillo|first2=Monica|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=September 21, 2015|access-date=March 21, 2016|archive-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324074615/http://www.ibtimes.com/veep-creator-armando-iannucci-explains-why-hes-still-leaving-show-season-5-after-best-2106324|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etiannucci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/166085_why_veep_creator_armando_iannucci_had_to_fire_himself/|title=Why 'Veep' Creator Armando Iannucci Had to Fire Himself|last=Lambe|first=Stacy|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=June 12, 2015|access-date=March 21, 2016|archive-date=March 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160611/http://www.etonline.com/news/166085_why_veep_creator_armando_iannucci_had_to_fire_himself/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
